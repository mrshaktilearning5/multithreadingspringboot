Concurrency
------------

Where two or more task can run simultaneously can be called as concurrency.
In java it can be achieved using threads.

Single core  machine: then task will run in inteleaved fashion

Multiple core machine : then task will run in simultaneously .
It uses shared resource , can work in both single and multi core machine

Parallelism
------------

It is the concept where two or more task run in parallel.

Below steps as whole knows as fork/join introduced in java 7
Steps:  breaks tasks in subtasks (forking) -> execure the subtask in sequential -> joining the result (join).

it uses more resource and can work in only multicore machine.
