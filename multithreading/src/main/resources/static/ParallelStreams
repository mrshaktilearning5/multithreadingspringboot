Parallel Streams
-----------------

-It allows the code to run in parallel
-This concept is designed to solve data parallelism.

|------------------------------------------------ |
|   It uses parallelStream() in place of stream() |
|-------------------------------------------------|



How Parallel streams work?
----------------------------
It internally uses forkjoin framework.

-split data into chunks
-execute chunks data
-combine chunks for final result


Note Impt:

In streams to collect data after performing either filter or map we want to get data as list and we
uses either collect or reduce for the same.

The key difference between Collect and Reduce is that Collect is immutable while reduce is mutable in terms of result.

Reduce is used when we want to get Result in single value not list , what we get using collect


- dont use parallel streams in case of Boxing or Unboxing
