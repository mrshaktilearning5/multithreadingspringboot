Form/Join Framework
----------------------Java 7

-It is extension of Executor Service
- Key Difference between Fork/Join and Executor Serive
    -Fork join -> Data parallelism
    -Executor Service - Task Based Parallelism


 How does the Fork/Join Framework works?
 -----------------------------------------

 As Fork Join Framework uses data parallelism , it uses form join pool


 Component of Fork Join Pool
 -----------------------------

 Shared work queue - In this client submits task

 Worker Threads - It contains Double ended work queues (Deck), this contineously pulls the task from the shared work queue
                  and task get taken by one of threads, and places task in its double ended work queue.
                  Task in deck always picks on LIFO order.

 Work stealing - In fork join framework the task is shared or steal by another thread from another end of queue
                 and hence executed and at end Result will be shared to client.

 ForkJoin Task
 --------------
 It represent part of the data and its computation


 Types of Task to submit to FormJoin Pool
 ------------------------------------------

 Recursive Task - it returns result value
 RecursiveAction - it does not return a value
