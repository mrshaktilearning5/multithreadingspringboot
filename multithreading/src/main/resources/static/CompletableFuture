CompletableFuture
-------------------- Java 8
It is asynchronous Reactive Functional programming Api

It allows to write asynchronous in functional style

It overcomes limitation of Future


CompletableFuture can be categorized into 3 category
------------------------------------------------------

Factory methods: these are static methods it initiate asynchronous computations

            methods: supplyAsync() it return CompletableFuture<T>

Completion Stage methods : It is completionStage methods
            methods : thenAccept() it returns CompletableFuture<Void>
            thenApply() :  it return a value
            thenCompose() : it transform data from one form to another. it returns CompletableFuture<T>
            use thenComponse only if you called other function before and waiting for response of that
            then using thenCompose refer method helloWorldThenCompose in code

Exception methods
